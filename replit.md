## Configuration

### Package Manager
- Using npm with `--legacy-peer-deps` for React 19 compatibility

### Development
- Server runs on port 5000 with host 0.0.0.0
- Hot reload enabled
- TypeScript and ESLint configured to ignore build errors (inherited from Vercel setup)

### Deployment
- Deployment target: autoscale (serverless)
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm run start`
- Images: unoptimized for compatibility

## Known Issues
- Next.js cross-origin warning appears in logs: This is a known Next.js experimental feature limitation. The warning is informational only and doesn't affect functionality. It says "In a future major version" so no action is needed until Next.js updates their implementation.
- React 19 requires legacy peer deps for some packages (vaul)
- TypeScript build errors are ignored per original configuration

## User Preferences
- App is in French (UI text and speech recognition configured for fr-FR)
- Productivity-focused design with energy tracking
